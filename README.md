# README #

This is the IPython repository for the Machine Learning: Regression course of Coursera. We will use k-nearest neighbors, lasso, ridge, and polynomial regression to predict house prices.

### What is this repository for? ###

* Week 1: In this notebook we will use data on house sales in King County to predict house prices using simple (one input) linear regression.
** Use graphlab SArray and SFrame functions to compute important summary statistics.
** Write a function to compute the Simple Linear Regression weights using the closed form solution.
** Write a function to make predictions of the output given the input feature.
** Turn the regression around to predict the input given the output.
** Compare two different models for predicting house prices.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Python version: 2.7.12
* GraphLab Create: greater than 1.7
* Dependencies: Numpy, Matplotlib, IPython
